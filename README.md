# Portfolio-Website
My personal website to highlight my areas of interest and showcase some of my work.
## Origin
Ever since I was introduced to some developer/designer websites, I've always appreciated the creative ways in which they display their hard work. I too would like to create a zone where others are able to develop an understanding of who I am. Conveying my *skillset*, the *focus* of my work, and *attributes* about myself is the objective of this website.
### Status
This will be a work in progress while I'm in school.
### Tech
React, Tailwind CSS
### Roadmap
I want include some feature relating to ðŸŸ¦â›“ blockchain, whether that be information or direct integration with a network. 
### Notes
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
